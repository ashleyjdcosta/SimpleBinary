# Simple Binary Message Codec

This is a simple binary message encoding and decoding scheme designed for use in a signaling protocol for real-time communication applications.

## Assumptions

- A message can contain a variable number of headers, and a binary payload.
- Header names and values are limited to 1023 bytes independently.
- A message can have a maximum of 63 headers.
- The message payload is limited to 256 KiB.

## Solution Overview

The solution consists of a `Message` class to represent messages, a `MessageCodec` interface, and a `SimpleMessageCodec` class that implements the encoding and decoding methods based on the provided specifications.

### Message Class

The `Message` class encapsulates the headers (as a dictionary) and the payload (as a byte array).

### MessageCodec Interface

The `MessageCodec` interface defines the contract for encoding and decoding methods.

### SimpleMessageCodec Class

The `SimpleMessageCodec` class implements the `MessageCodec` interface.
- The `Encode` method converts a `Message` object into a binary representation.
- The `Decode` method converts binary data back into a `Message` object.

## How to Use

1. Create a `Message` instance with headers and a payload.
2. Create an instance of `SimpleMessageCodec`.
3. Use the `Encode` method to encode the message into binary data.
4. Use the `Decode` method to decode binary data back into a `Message` object.

## Assumptions and Customization

- The implementation assumes ASCII-encoded strings for header names and values.
- Headers exceeding the defined size limits will cause exceptions.
- The `SimpleMessageCodec` class includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.

## Possible Upgrades

- Implementing compression for payloads to reduce data size.
- Adding support for various endianness for cross-system compatibility.
- Optimize memory usage and performance for larger payloads.
- Implementing custom exceptions for better error reporting.

## Note

This implementation aims for simplicity while providing a basic structure for a binary message codec. Production deployments should consider further optimizations, security measures, and additional validation based on specific use cases.
